Hello Friends! We know everyone is excited about the new features in Ionic
Framework 6.0 beta, but that doesn't mean we're done with V5! In Ionic React
5.6, we packaged up a new set of hooks for controlling our overlay components
that we think you might like. What is an overlay you ask? It’s the term we give
components that display over your current content, such as alerts, modals,
toasts, etc. 

In this post, I’m going to go over how to use the new hooks to
display these components in your apps. But first, let's do a quick recap on how
overlays worked before, and some of the challenges that you might encounter with
them.

## Overlay Components

Each of the overlays has a
React component that is exported from `@ionic/react`, such as `IonAlert` and
`IonLoading`. These components take a prop called `isOpen`, which determines if
the overlay should be displayed or
not:

```ts
<IonAlert
 isOpen={showAlert}
/>
```

These components are great
and they aren’t going away. The new hooks don't deprecate them in any way.
However, there's some ceremony you have to observe to use them. 

First,
managing the state that handles the `isOpen` prop could be a challenge. If the
state was contained in the component that the overlay was in, then it was no
problem (like a local state variable from `useState`). However, if the action to
display the overlays was in a different part of the app, then you needed to use
some state management technique or library to pass the `isOpen` prop
along.

Second, each of the Overlay components required you to provide an
`onDidDismiss` callback that would flip the `isOpen` prop back to false in case
the overlay dismissed itself somehow. Not overriding it would cause `isOpen` to
stay true, and if your app tried to show the overlay again, then you would be
setting true to true, and Ionic wouldn’t detect the change and, thus, wouldn't
display it
again.

```ts
<IonAlert
 isOpen={showAlert}
 message='Hello there friend'
 onDidDismiss={() => setShowAlert(false)}
/>
```

A
third challenge was that it was difficult to display an overlay from outside of
your component; for instance, if you wanted to display an alert when an API
request failed. Ionic Angular had controller instances you could import to use
in services to display overlays. In React, this was more difficult to do.

The
new overlay hooks in Ionic React 5.6 help with all these scenarios.

##
Overlay Hooks

The goal of the overlay hooks was to reduce this process and to
make the usage of the overlays feel more natural for those writing functional
React components.

To get started with the hooks, you import the hook for the
overlay you want to use from `@ionic/react` like
so:

```ts
import { useIonAlert } from '@ionic/react'
```

Next, in your
functional component, you call the hook to get back the show and hide methods,
which get returned in an array similar to how `useState` returns its members. We
choose the array method of destructuring so naming the methods is
easier:

```ts
const [showAlert, hideAlert] = useIonAlert();
```

> Most
overlays dismiss themselves when the user is done interacting with them, so you
won’t need the hide method for most scenarios.

Then to display the overlay,
you call the show method:

```ts
showAlert('Hello!');
```

<a

src="https://blog.ionicframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alert-overlay.png"
alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3764" /></a>

The alert will
dismiss itself after the user clicks the "Ok" button. You don’t need to worry
about doing any additional work when the overlays go away.

Most of the
overlay hooks have options that you can pass to them. The more common options
can be passed in as additional parameters. For instance, the toast overlay's
show method also takes the time to display the toast as its second
parameter:

```ts
showToast('Hello from a toast!', 3000);
```

This will
display the toast for three seconds, and then the toast will dismiss
itself.

More options can be sent by passing in an object instead of the
separate
parameters:

```ts
showToast({
 buttons: [{ text: 'hide', handler: () => hideToast() }],
 message: 'Hello, click hide to dismiss',
 onDidDismiss: () => console.log('dismissed') 
})
```

React
hooks can be used in other hooks as well. Because of this, it's possible to
display an overlay from within other hooks, such as one responsible for fetching
some data. Here is a sample custom hook to fetch a customer that displays a
toast when the request
fails:

```ts
const useCustomer = (customerId: number) => {
 const [customer, setCustomer] = useState<Customer>();
 const [showToast] = useIonToast();
 useEffect(() => {
 fetchCustomer();
 async function fetchCustomer() {
 try {
 const response = fetch(`myapi.com/customers/${customerId}`);
 const data = await (await response).json();
 setCustomer(data);
 } catch {
 showToast({
 message: 'Oops, unable to get customer',
 color: 'warning',
 buttons: [{ icon: close }],
 });
 }
 }
 }, [customerId, showToast]);
 return customer;
};
```
