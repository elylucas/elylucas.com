I will be giving a hands-on lab on Friday, October 23rd.

jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that can be used to build rich, interactive, client-side applications. Microsoft has committed to integrating jQuery into both ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC frameworks. This lab will cover how to build interactive apps using jQuery, especially geared towards the ASP.NET Web Forms programmer.
